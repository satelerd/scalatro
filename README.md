# Scalatro

**Scalatro: Balatro but you're an AI company**

A roguelike card game where you manage an AI company, accumulating computing power and resources to surpass benchmarks and dominate the market.

## Concept

In Scalatro, you run an AI startup competing to dominate the market. You'll manage:

- **Chips** (Pre-training compute): The foundation of your models
- **Multipliers** (Test-time compute): The efficiency of your inferences
- **Jokers** (GPUs, data, etc.): Powerups that boost your company
- **Benchmarks**: Challenges you must overcome to continue growing

The goal is to build the most powerful AI company by overcoming increasingly difficult benchmarks and gaining market share against the competition.

## Technologies

- Next.js with App Router
- Bun as runtime
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for global state
- Framer Motion and React-Konva for animations

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies

## Latest Updates

- **v0.2.0 (Current)**: English translation of the entire game
- **v0.1.0**: Initial version with game mechanics, shop functionality, and card dragging system

## Roadmap
